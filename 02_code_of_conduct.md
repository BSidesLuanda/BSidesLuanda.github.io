CODE OF CONDUCT

BSides Luanda was founded sharing the philosophy of fellow BSides events: a community organized event to come together to learn, share, and network.

A fundamental requirement for achieving this goal is a respectful environment.  Insults and harassment are unacceptable. This includes intimidation and/or targeting an individual in a manner that makes them feel unwelcome.  Harassment does not include discussing opposing viewpoints in a civil manner.

Simple Expectations:
	• Be an ADULT
	• Be respectful, polite, honourable, tolerant and a positive contributor to our event and society
	• Do not be crass, rude, ignorant or demeaning
	• Do unto others as you would have them do unto you


This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating in BSides Luanda, including planners, attendees, speakers, and volunteers.

If you experience/witness behavior conflicting with our code of conduct, please contact a volunteer or staff. Both BSides Luanda volunteers and staff will be happy to assist. 

Reporting can also be done via @BSidesLDA or via email to info@bsidesluanda.org.


Liability:
BSides Luanda is not responsible for any actions of attendees, speakers, volunteers or other participants.

"This Code of Conduct inspired by BSidesLisbon and  BSides Pittsburgh Code of Conduct".
