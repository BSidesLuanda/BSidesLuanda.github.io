                <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
                <p>BSides Luanda was founded sharing the philosophy of fellow BSides events: a community organized event to come together to learn, share, and network.
                   A fundamental requirement for achieving this goal is a respectful environment.  Insults and harassment are unacceptable. This includes intimidation and/or targeting an individual in a manner that makes them feel unwelcome.  Harassment does not include discussing opposing viewpoints in a civil manner.
                   
                   Simple Expectations:
                    • Be an ADULT
                    • Be respectful, polite, honourable, tolerant and a positive contributor to our event and society
                    • Do not be crass, rude, ignorant or demeaning
                    • Do unto others as you would have them do unto you


                   This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating in BSides Luanda, including planners, attendees, speakers, and volunteers.
                   If you experience/witness behavior conflicting with our code of conduct, please contact a volunteer or venue staff. Both BSides Luanda volunteers and Rivers Casino staff will be happy to assist. 

                   Reporting can also be done via @BSidesLDA or via email to info@bsidesluanda.org.

                   Liability:
                   Bsides Luanda is not responsible for any actions of attendees, speakers, volunteers or other participants.

                   "This Code of Conduct inspired by BSidesLisbon and  BSides Pittsburgh Code of Conduct".</p>
