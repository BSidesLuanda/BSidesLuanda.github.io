MISSION STATEMENT

BSidesLuanda is a non-profit educational organization designed to advance the body of Information Security knowledge, by providing an annual, one day, open forum for discussion and debate for security engineers and their affiliates. 
..
We produce a conference that is a source of education, collaboration, and continued conversation for information technologists and those associated with this field. The technical and academic presentations at BSidesLuanda are given in the spirit of peer review and advanced knowledge dissemination. 
..
This allows the field of Information Security to grow in breadth and depth, and continue in its pursuit of highly advanced scientifically based knowledge.
